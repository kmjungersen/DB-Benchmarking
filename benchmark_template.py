"""
DB Benchmarking Application
===========================

Benchmark.py

This file houses the basic template for a new module's `main.py`.  This template
** MUST BE FOLLOWED ** in order for the benchmarking application to function
properly.  Read the docstrings carefully!

NOTE: Any variable settings needed for this module should be housed in a
`local.py` file in the module directory.  Then import those settings like so:

    from local import *

Now any settings defined there can be accessed from the `Benchmark` class.
